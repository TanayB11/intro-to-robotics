# intro-to-robotics

## This repository is an archive of code/CAD drawings from Intro to Robotics (2018-2019)


## Information about each directory


**learning-cad** houses the files from the section of the course in which we were learning to create CAD drawings.

**robot-car** houses the code for controlling an Elegoo Arduino car. We used various methods to make the car travel through a maze.

**spring-competition** houses code and CAD files for an [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)-style class competition. It only has the files I worked on, not that of my teammates (because I chose to open-source this.

**spring-final-project** contains the basic code I wrote to create an induction-powered LED system using and Arduino and two coils of ferrite.
