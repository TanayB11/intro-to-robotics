# intro-to-robotics

### An archive of code/CAD drawings from Intro to Robotics (2018-2019)


## Information about each directory


**learning-cad**
* Contains files from when we were learning to create CAD drawings.

**robot-car**
* Houses code for controlling an Elegoo Arduino car. We used various methods to make the car travel through a maze.

**spring-competition**
* Contains code and CAD files for a [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) style class competition. 
* It only has the files I worked on, not those of my teammates (because I chose to open-source my work).

**spring-final-project**
* Houses the basic code I wrote to create an induction-powered LED system using and Arduino and two coils of ferrite.
* This is my favorite project I made in this class.
